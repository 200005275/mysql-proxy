Installing from SVN
===================

Get the SVN source from:

  $ svn co .../mysql-proxy/trunk/ mysql-proxy/

Later you can update the tree by running

  $ cd mysql-proxy/
  $ svn up

As you built from SVN none of the configure scripts is prepared. You need:

- autoconf 2.56 or higer
- automake 1.9 or higher

to generate the configure script. Use the provided autogen.sh to rebuild 
the config-scripts:

  $ sh ./autogen.sh

You should have a configure script, ready to build.

Installing from Source 
======================

  $ gzip -cd mysql-proxy-0.5.0.tar.gz | tar xf -
  $ cd mysql-proxy-0.5.0

Preparing the Build
===================

As you have the source in the right place and the configure script exists, you have 
to make sure that the dependencies are in place;

- libevent 1.x or higher (1.3b or later is prefered)
- lua 5.1
- glib2 2.4.0 or higer
- pkg-config 

Ubuntu/Debian
-------------

  $ apt-get install \
      pkg-config \
      liblua5.1 \
      liblua5.1-dev \
      libevent-dev \
      libevent  \
      libglib2.0-0 \
      libglib2.0-0-dev 

On Debian and Ubuntu you need to tell the configure script that it has to use 
"pkg-config lua5.1" to detect the lua-libriaries instead of the default 
"pkg-config lua".

  $ ./configure --with-lua=lua5.1

All other Platforms
-------------------

  $ ./configure 

Building
========

  $ make
  $ make install

You should have a /usr/local/sbin/mysql-proxy now.
